# Berachain Block Exporter

A monitoring tool that tracks block production on Berachain's consensus and execution layers, specifically designed to monitor validator block proposals and their corresponding execution blocks.

## Features

- Monitors validator block proposals on the consensus layer
- Tracks corresponding blocks on the execution layer
- Provides Prometheus metrics for monitoring
- Configurable via TOML configuration file
- Real-time logging of block production
- Tracks gaps between consensus and execution layers

## Metrics

The exporter provides the following Prometheus metrics:

- `validator_total_blocks_proposed`: Total number of blocks proposed by the validator
- `validator_execution_blocks_confirmed`: Number of blocks confirmed on execution layer
- `validator_execution_blocks_missed`: Number of blocks that failed to make it to execution layer
- `validator_empty_consensus_blocks`: Number of empty blocks on consensus layer
- `validator_empty_execution_blocks`: Number of empty blocks on execution layer
- `validator_block_processing_errors`: Number of errors encountered
- `validator_current_block_height`: Current block height being processed
- `validator_el_to_cl_gap`: Gap between execution and consensus layer heights

## Configuration

Create a `config.toml` file:

```toml
evm_address = "" # Validator's EVM address
target_validator = "" # Validator's consensus address
rpc_endpoint = "" # Consensus layer RPC
eth_endpoint = "" # Execution layer RPC
log_file = "block_monitor.log" # Log file path
metrics_port = ":2113" # Prometheus metrics port
enable_file_log = false # Enable file logging
enable_stdout = true # Enable console logging
```

## Usage

```bash
# Run with config file
go run main.go --config=./config.toml

# Build binary
go build -o berachain-exporter

# Run binary
./berachain-exporter --config=./config.toml
```

## Metrics Endpoint

Prometheus metrics are available at `http://localhost:2113/metrics`

## Requirements

- Go 1.22.1 or later
- Access to Berachain RPC endpoints

## Dependencies

Main dependencies:

- github.com/BurntSushi/toml: Configuration file parsing
- github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum: Ethereum client
